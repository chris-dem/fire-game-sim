# Model plan

Planning to impement the model as follows

* DenseNumberGrid for Fire
* DenseObjectGrid for Evacuees

## Implementation for fire

Use invisible `fire_spread` agent to implement fire rules. KEEP IN MIND. MIGHT NEED TO AFFECT THE SIMULATION OTHERWISE DUE TO SOCIAL FORCES

READ UP TOMORROW ABOUT SOCIAL FORCES AND FIRE.
